# TinyCPPI

A simple and lightweight prop ownership solution for Developers in Garry's Mod.
You can return the owner of any entity by using the function Entity:CPPIGetOwner(). Works both Server and Clientside.

Important note: This does not overwrite any functions if you're using ULX / FPP. However, this also means that this Addon will be useless.
